Example Usage
------------------------------------------------

Note that for each of these examples, SAMPLE_PROJ is the folder where the
student submissions are tarballed to. working is the directory selected for
the submissions to be extracted to.

See help information:
./turnin_helper.py --help

Extract sample project(s) to current folder by default:
./turnin_helper.py -x SAMPLE_PROJ
	Notice the addition of the bboe-1 folder (most recent bboe submission)
	Notice the extract_log file added inside this folder

Extract sample project(s) to "working" directory
./turnin_helper.py -x SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working
	Must answer yes to the confirmation question

Compile already extracted project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper.py -m SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working
	Note the addition of the make_log file inside the project folder(s)
	Notice: running student submitted makefiles can be dangerous as they
	can do something like `rm -rf ~` which will delete everything in your
	directory. I recommend not allowing students to make modifications to
	the makefile and providing a known clean makefile via the --makefile
	option.

Clean up (delete) project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper.py --work-dir=working --purge SAMPLE_PROJ
	Note that this will only delete folders and their contents which
	correspond to the folders created via extraction. If the working folder
	happens to be empty after all the project folders have been deleted
	then a confirmation will appear asking if you'd like to delete the
	working folder.

Extract and run `make clean` on sample project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper.py -m SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working --target=clean

Generate a spreadsheet named SAMPLE_PROJ.csv with columns for student first 
names, last names, usernames, and GRADE file contents. GRADE files are
described later in this document.
./turnin_helper.py --csv SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working


------------------------------------------------
Proceedure to batch email students their grades
------------------------------------------------
Once a project has been extracted a grade emails can be sent to all the
students in one simple proceedure. There are a couple of features here:

  - In each student's project directory a GRADE file can be created. If a
    project has a GRADE file in it, when invoking the --email function that
    student will be sent an email containing the contents of this file. Emails
    are constructed from the student's username@cs.ucsb.edu. This might
    potentially cause problems with CE and visiting students, but I'm not sure.
    Conversely students without a GRADE file will not receive an email.
  - In the working directory a generic GRADE file can be created. This will be
    be appended to the individial message a student receives. Incredibly useful
    for generic information about the project's grading.

Example proceedure for emailing me (bboe) with the sample project:
./turnin_helper.py -x SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working
echo "Generic info about SAMPLE_PROJ" > working/GRADE
echo "BBOE specific info regarding SAMPLE_PROJ" > working/bboe-1/GRADE
./turnin_helper.py --email=bboe SAMPLE_PROJ/ --work-dir=working

The email I receive looks like:
From: Bryce Boe <bboe@cs.ucsb.edu>
Received: from csil.cs.ucsb.edu (localhost [127.0.0.1])
	  by csil.cs.ucsb.edu (8.14.3/8.14.3) with ESMTP id n9F51GkM023424
